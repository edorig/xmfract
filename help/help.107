    Orbit in three dimensions defined by:

      x(0) = y(0) = z(0) = 1
      x(n+1) = x(n) - y(n)*dt -   z(n)*dt
      y(n+1) = y(n) + x(n)*dt + a*y(n)*dt
      z(n+1) = z(n) + b*dt + x(n)*z(n)*dt - c*z(n)*dt

    Parameters are dt, a, b, and c.


This fractal is named after the German Otto Rossler, a non-practicing
medical doctor who approached chaos with a bemusedly philosophical
attitude. He would see strange attractors as philosophical objects. His
fractal namesake looks like a band of ribbon with a fold in it. All we can
say is we used the same calculus-teacher-defeating trick of multiplying
the equations by "dt" to solve the differential equation and generate the
orbit. This time we will skip straight to the orbit generator - if you
followed what we did above with type Lorenz you can easily reverse
engineer the differential equations.

             xnew = x - y*dt -   z*dt
             ynew = y + x*dt + a*y*dt
             znew = z + b*dt + x*z*dt - c*z*dt

Default parameters are dt = .04, a = .2, b = .2, c = 5.7
