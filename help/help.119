Circle Fractal Types

formulas: circle


    Circle pattern by John Connett

      x + iy = pixel
      z = a*(x^2 + y^2)
      c = integer part of z

      color = c modulo(number of colors)


This fractal type is from A. K. Dewdney's "Computer Recreations" column
in "Scientific American". It is attributed to John Connett of the
University of Minnesota.

(Don't tell anyone, but this fractal type is not really a fractal!)

Fascinating Moire patterns can be formed by calculating x^2 + y^2 for
each pixel in a piece of the complex plane. After multiplication by a
magnification factor (the parameter), the number is truncated to an integer
and mapped to a color via color = value modulo (number of colors). That is,
the integer is divided by the number of colors, and the remainder is the
color index value used. The resulting image is not a fractal because all
detail is lost after zooming in too far.
