Tear-Off Menus

Xmfract supports tear-off menus, if the user has not specifically
prevented it by an entry in the resource file. Menus may be "torn off",
or posted in windows of their own (seperate from the main window), by
selecting the dashed line at the top of the menu. To dismiss any torn-off
menu, press the 'Esc' key while the pointer is in the menu window.
