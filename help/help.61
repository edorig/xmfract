julfn+exp

    A generalized Clifford Pickover fractal.

      z(0) = pixel
      z(n+1) = fn(z(n)) + e^z(n) + c.

    Three parameters: real & imaginary parts of c, and fn


These types have been explored by Clifford A. Pickover, of the IBM Thomas
J. Watson Research center. As implemented in xmfract, they are regular
Mandelbrot/Julia set pairs that may be plotted with or without the
{=@Biomorphs "biomorph"} option Pickover used to create organic-looking
beasties (see below). These types are produced with formulas built from
the functions z^z, z^n, sin(z), and e^z for complex z. Types with "power"
or "pwr" in their name have an exponent value as a third parameter. For
example, type=manzpower params=0/0/2 is our old friend the classical
Mandelbrot, and type=manzpower params=0/0/4 is the Quartic Mandelbrot.
Other values of the exponent give still other fractals. Since these WERE
the original "biomorph" types, we should give an example. Try:

    type=manfn+zsqrd biomorph=0 corners=-8/8/-6/6 function=sin

to see a big biomorph digesting little biomorphs!
