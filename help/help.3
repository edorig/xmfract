Three-dimensional Fractal Parameters

The parameters on this screen are a subset of the zillions of options
available for xmfract's 3D image transformations.

This screen's parameters are those which also affect 3D fractal types like
lorenz3d and kamtorus3d.

Since they are documented elsewhere, we won't repeat ourselves:

For a description of rotation, perspective, and shift parameters, please
see "Rectangular Coordinate Transformation". Ignore the paragraphs about
"scaling" and "water level" - those parts apply only to 3D Transforms.

For a description of the stereo option, please see the "stereo" subheading
in "3D Mode Selection".
