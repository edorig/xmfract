Help on Help

Many help buttons are available throughout the program.
When a dialog is displayed, press the Help button for more information.

For a detailed description of a specific fractal formula, select the
topic "Summary of Fractal Types" from the help index, or highlight a
fractal type from the fractal type selection dialog, then press the help
button to get more information about that type.

In general, pressing the "Done" button in a dialog will accept the
values displayed unless an error is detected. Pressing the "Reset"
button will reset the values to those that were in effect when the
dialog was invoked. Pressing the "Default" button will set the values
to preset default values. Pressing the "Cancel" button will cause the
dialog to disappear without changing any values. Other specialized
buttons, menus, and option menus are available in some dialogs. Use the
on-line help system to guide you through the maze of fractal parameters.
