Image Save/Restore Commands

<s> saves the current image to disk. All parameters required to recreate
the image are saved with it. Progress is marked by colored lines moving
down the screen's edges.

<r> restores an image previously saved with <s>, or an ordinary GIF file.
After pressing <r> you are shown the file names in the current directory
which match the current file mask.
