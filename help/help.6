Three-dimensional Mode Selection

After hitting <3> and getting past the filename prompt, you're presented
with a "3d Mode Selection" screen.

Preview Mode:
   Preview mode provides a rapid look at your transformed image using by
   skipping a lot of rows and filling the image in. Good for quickly
   discovering the best parameters. Let's face it, the Fractint authors
   most famous for "blazingly fast" code *DIDN'T* write the 3D routines!
   [Pieter: "But they *are* picking away it and making some progress in
   each release."]

Show Box:
   If you have selected Preview Mode you have another option to worry
   about. This is the option to show the image box in scaled and rotated
   coordinates x, y, and z. The box only appears in rectangular
   transformations and shows how the final image will be oriented. If you
   select light source in the next screen, it will also show you the
   light source vector so you can tell where the light is coming from in
   relation to your image. Sorry no head or tail on the vector yet.

Coarseness:
   This sets how many divisions the image will be divided into in the y
   direction, if you select preview mode, ray tracing output, or grid fill
   in the "Select Fill Type" screen.

Spherical Projection:
   The next question asks if you want a sphere projection. This will take
   your image and map it onto a plane if you answer "no" or a sphere if
   you answer "yes" as described above. Try it and you'll see what we
   mean.

Stereo:
   Stereo sound in xmfract? Well, not yet. xmfract now allows you to
   create 3D images for use with red/blue glasses like 3D comics you may
   have seen, or images like Captain EO.

   Option 0 is normal old 3D you can look at with just your eyes.

   Options 1 and 2 require the special red/blue-green glasses. They are
   meant to be viewed right on the screen or on a color print off of the
   screen. The image can be made to hover entirely or partially in front
   of the screen. Great fun!  These two options give a gray scale image
   when viewed.

   Option 1 gives 64 shades of gray but with half the spatial resolution
   you have selected. It works by writing the red and blue images on
   adjacent pixels, which is why it eats half your resolution. In
   general, we recommend you use this only with resolutions above
   640x350. Use this mode for continuous potential landscapes where you
   *NEED* all those shades.

   Option "2" gives you full spatial resolution but with only 16 shades
   of gray. If the red and blue images overlap, the colors are mixed.
   Good for wire-frame images (we call them surface grids), lorenz3d and
   3D IFS. Works fine in 16 color modes.

   Option 3 is for creating stereo pair images for view later with more
   specialized equipment. It allows full color images to be presented in
   glorious stereo. The left image presented on the screen first. You may
   photograph it or save it. Then the second image is presented, you may
   do the same as the first image. You can then take the two images and
   convert them to a stereo image pair as outlined by Bruce Goren.
