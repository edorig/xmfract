Phoenix Fractal Type

formulas: phoenix, mandphoenix


The phoenix type defaults to the original phoenix curve discovered by
Shigehiro Ushiki, "Phoenix", IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems,
Vol. 35, No. 7, July 1988, pp. 788-789. These images do not have the
X and Y axis swapped as is normal for this type.

The mandphoenix type is the corresponding Mandelbrot set image of the
phoenix type. The spacebar toggles between the two as long as the
mandphoenix type has an initial Z(0) of (0,0). The mandphoenix is not
an effective index to the phoenix type, so explore the wild blue yonder.

To reproduce the Mandelbrot set image of the phoenix type as shown in
Stevens' book, "Fractal Programming in C", set initorbit=0/0 on the
command line or with the <g> key. The colors need to be rotated one
position because Stevens uses the values from the previous calculation
instead of the current calculation to determine when to bailout.
