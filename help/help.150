Complex Newton

formulas: complexnewton, complexbasin


Well, hey, "Z^n - 1" is so boring when you can use "Z^a - b" where "a" and
"b" are complex numbers!  The new "complexnewton" and "complexbasin"
fractal types are just the old "newton" and "newtbasin" fractal types with
this little added twist. When you select these fractal types, you are
prompted for four values (the real and imaginary portions of "a" and "b").
If "a" has a complex portion, the fractal has a discontinuity along the
negative axis - relax, we finally figured out that it's *supposed* to be
there!
