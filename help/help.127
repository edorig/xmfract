Henon Attractors

formulas: henon


Michel Henon was an astronomer at Nice observatory in southern France. He
came to the subject of fractals via investigations of the orbits of
astronomical objects. The strange attractor most often linked with
Henon's name comes not from a differential equation, but from the world of
discrete mathematics - difference equations. The Henon map is an example
of a very simple dynamic system that exhibits strange behavior. The orbit
traces out a characteristic banana shape, but on close inspection, the
shape is made up of thicker and thinner parts. Upon magnification, the
thicker bands resolve to still other thick and thin components. And so it
goes forever! The equations that generate this strange pattern perform the
mathematical equivalent of repeated stretching and folding, over and over
again.

         xnew =  1 + y - a*x*x\
         ynew =  b*x\

The default parameters are a=1.4 and b=.3.
