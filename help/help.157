Rossler Attractors

formulas: rossler3D


This fractal is named after the German Otto Rossler, a non-practicing
medical doctor who approached chaos with a bemusedly philosophical
attitude. He would see strange attractors as philosophical objects. His
fractal namesake looks like a band of ribbon with a fold in it. All we can
say is we used the same calculus-teacher-defeating trick of multiplying
the equations by "dt" to solve the differential equation and generate the
orbit. This time we will skip straight to the orbit generator - if you
followed what we did above with type Lorenz you can easily reverse
engineer the differential equations.

             xnew = x - y*dt -   z*dt
             ynew = y + x*dt + a*y*dt
             znew = z + b*dt + x*z*dt - c*z*dt

Default parameters are dt = .04, a = .2, b = .2, c = 5.7
