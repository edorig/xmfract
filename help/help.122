Fn||Fn Fractal Types

formulas: lambda(fn||fn), manlam(fn||fn), julia(fn||fn), mandel(fn||fn)


Two functions=[sin|cos|sinh|cosh|exp|log|sqr|...]) are specified with
these types. The two functions are alternately used in the calculation
based on a comparison between the modulus of the current Z and the
shift value. The first function is used if the modulus of Z is less
than the shift value and the second function is used otherwise.

The lambda(fn||fn) type calculates the Julia set of the formula
lambda*fn(Z), for various values of the function "fn", where lambda
and Z are both complex. Two values, the real and imaginary parts of
lambda, should be given in the "params=" option. The third value is
the shift value. The space bar will generate the corresponding
"psuedo Mandelbrot" set, manlam(fn||fn).

The manlam(fn||fn) type calculates the "psuedo Mandelbrot" set of the
formula fn(Z)*C, for various values of the function "fn", where C
and Z are both complex. Two values, the real and imaginary parts of
Z(0), should be given in the "params=" option. The third value is
the shift value. The space bar will generate the corresponding
julia set, lamda(fn||fn).

The julia(fn||fn) type calculates the Julia set of the formula
fn(Z)+C, for various values of the function "fn", where C
and Z are both complex. Two values, the real and imaginary parts of
C, should be given in the "params=" option. The third value is
the shift value. The space bar will generate the corresponding
mandelbrot set, mandel(fn||fn).

The mandel(fn||fn) type calculates the Mandelbrot set of the formula
fn(Z)+C, for various values of the function "fn", where C
and Z are both complex. Two values, the real and imaginary parts of
Z(0), should be given in the "params=" option. The third value is
the shift value. The space bar will generate the corresponding
julia set, julia(fn||fn).
