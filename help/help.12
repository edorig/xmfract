Color Cycling Commands

Color-cycling mode is entered with the 'c', '+', or '-' keys.

Color cycling applies to the color numbers selected by the "cyclerange="
command line parameter (also changeable via the <y> options screen and via
the palette editor). By default, color numbers 1 to 255 inclusive are
cycled. On some images you might want to set "inside=0" (<x> options or
command line parameter) to exclude the "lake" from color cycling.

The cursor up/down arrow keys and/or the keypad up/down keys will increase
and decrease the cycle speed.

Pressing the left or right arrow keys will cause the palette to rotate
one step in the indicated direction. Holding down either of these keys
will cause the palette to rotate continuously in the desired direction
until the key is released. Select "Reset color" from the "Reset" menu
to cause the palette to rotate to the "beginning" of the range.
