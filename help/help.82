mandelcloud

    Displays orbits of Mandelbrot set:

      z(0) = c = pixel
      z(n+1) = z(n)^2 + c.

    One parameter: number of intervals


This fractal computes the Mandelbrot function, but displays it differently.
It starts with regularly spaced initial pixels and displays the resulting
orbits. This idea is somewhat similar to the Dynamic System.

There are two options that have unusual effects on this fractal. The
Orbit Delay value controls how many initial points are computed before
the orbits are displayed on the screen. This allows the orbit to settle
down. The outside=summ option causes each pixel to increment color every
time an orbit touches it; the resulting display is a 2-d histogram.

This fractal was invented by Noel Giffin.
