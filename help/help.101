    Orbit in three dimensions defined by:

      x(n+1) = sin(a*y(n)) - z(n)*cos(b*x(n))
      y(n+1) = z(n)*sin(c*x(n)) - cos(d*y(n))
      z(n+1) = sin(x(n))

    Parameters: a, b, c, and d.


Clifford A. Pickover of the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research center is such a
creative source for fractals that we attach his name to this one only with
great trepidation. Probably tomorrow he'll come up with another one and
we'll be back to square one trying to figure out a name!

This one is the three dimensional orbit defined by:

             xnew = sin(a*y) - z*cos(b*x)
             ynew = z*sin(c*x) - cos(d*y)
             znew = sin(x)

Default parameters are: a = 2.24, b = .43, c = -.65, d = -2.43
