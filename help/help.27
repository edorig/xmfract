Orbits Window Mode

The <o> key turns on the orbit mode. In this mode a cursor appears
over the fractal. A window appears showing the orbit used in the
calculation of the color at the point where the cursor is. Move the
cursor around the fractal using the arrow keys or the mouse and watch
the orbits change. Try entering the orbits mode with View Windows (<v>)
turned on.

The following keys take effect in orbits mode.

Upper case 'C'   Circle toggle - makes little circles with radii inversely
                 proportional to the iteration. Press <C> again to toggle
                 back to point-by-point or line mode display of orbits.

Upper case 'L'   Line toggle - connects orbits with lines. Press <L> again
                 to toggle back to point-by-point or circle mode display
                 of orbits.


The circle toggle and line toggle orbit modes may be used simultaneously.
