Mandelbrot(function) Fractal Type

formulas: mandelfn


Function=[sin|cos|sinh|cosh|exp|log|sqr|...]) is specified with this type.

Prior to [FRACTINT] version 14, these types were mandelsine, mandelcos,
mandelsinh, mandelcos, and mandelexp.

These are "pseudo-Mandelbrot" mappings for the LambdaFn Julia functions.
They map to their corresponding Julia sets via the spacebar command in
exactly the same fashion as the original M/J sets. In general, they are
interesting mainly because of that property (the function=exp set in
particular is rather boring). Generate the appropriate "Mandelfn" set,
zoom on a likely spot where the colors are changing rapidly, and hit the
spacebar key to plot the Julia set for that particular point.

Try "xmfract type=mandelfn corners=4.68/4.76/-.03/.03 function=cos" for a
graphic demonstration that we're not taking Mandelbrot's name in vain
here. We didn't even know these little buggers were here until Mark
Peterson found this a few hours before the version incorporating Mandelfns
was released.
